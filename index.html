        <p>We have a lot of issues to tackle in this country.&nbsp; Climate Crisis, a broken Healthcare system, racial
            injustice, the list goes on.&nbsp; Our entrenched two party system makes progress impossible. To break
            through the power of self-interested, corrupt politicians, we need to upgrade our voting system beyond
            &ldquo;lesser of two evils&rdquo;.</p>

                <li>Especially if there is an upcoming election at the City / State level, even asking if they support
                    this puts it on their radar, and if you ask publicly you are raising awareness at the same time.
